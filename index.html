<h1 style="font-family:arial; color: #f64c72" ">Understanding Wireless Networks</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:arial; ">What is Wireless Networks?</h2>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-size: 12;">A wireless network is an internet connection that utilizes radio waves to send data instead of wires, hence enabling devices to communicate with each other without being connected by cables. Based on the wireless technology principle, the electromagnetic waves are used in carrying the signals that will then be transmitted to the receiver of the signal. People are increasingly using wireless networks due to their convenience of allowing users to freely move while simultaneously using devices such as cell phones and laptops. However, along with this ease of access brought by wireless networks is the risk of the hackers penetrating one’s information security system. A wireless network without secretly will not be able to detect, prevent, or control unauthorized network access.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:arial; ">Types of Wireless Networks</h2>
<ol>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Wireless Lan (WLAN) - A type of wireless network that provides wireless connectivity within a limited area. It is often used in homes, offices, and public spaces that's why it can be called a home network. WLAN design is only simple wherein a modem is connected to the cable or fiber from a local service provider. A wireless router is then connected to the modem which serves as the receiver of signal from the modem. It often uses Wi-Fi technology based on the IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless communication.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) - Unlike WLAN, which is a home network, WMAN provides wireless connectivity within metropolitan areas and enables mobile devices to access network resources while on the move.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) - A type of wireless network that provides wireless connectivity within a short range, typically within a personal space of a person only such as a room. It uses protocoles like Bluetooth that enables a user to connect a phone to earpieces or transmit signals between devices and Zigbee that connect stations along an Internet on Things (IoT) network.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Wireless WAN (WWAN) - This allows devices to connect to internet or computer networks through utilizing cellular networks such as 3G, LTE, and 5G.</li>
</ol>
<h1 style="font-family:arial; color: #f64c72" ">Why Do I Need to Evaluate the Security of a Wireless Network?</h1>
<ol>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Protection of Data - Evaluating the security of a wireless network helps ensure that sensitive data such as personal information and financial details are protected from unauthorized access, interception, or manipulation.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Prevention of Unauthorized Access - Since wireless networks are susceptible to unauthorized access, evaluating its security will help mitigate the potential entry points that could be exploited by unauthorized users.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Risk Mitigation - An individual, including me, will be able to implement appropriate security measures to lessen the likelihood of security breaches.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Protection of Reputation - Through evaluating the security of a wireless network, sensitive information is protected to ensure that security breaches and data leaks that can damage the reputation will not occur.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Prevention of Malicious Activities - Malicious activities will be prevented leading to the integrity and availability of network resources being safeguarded.</li>
</ol>
<h1 style="font-family:arial; color: #f64c72" ">Steps on Evaluating the Security of a Wireless Network</h1>
<ol>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Identify the wireless devices that are accessing your network - Document every detail about each device accessing your network so that you can examine all active traffic in your wireless network and through all the wireless devices connected.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Detecting rogue devices - Rouge devices refers to the devices that should not be there on your network. Through utilizing the list of the devices accessing your network obtained from doing the first step and comparing it to the inventory of devices that you have with you, you will be able to discover rogue devices. Block these rouge devices to avoid security issues.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Secure your Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) - Ensure that all WAPs have the latest security patches and firmware installed. Change the default password to a stronger password and make sure to configure the WAP to utilize the most secure options.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Continuous Monitoring and improvement - Review security configurations regularly and ensure that policies are updated. Additionally, make sure that your device inventory is regularly updated so that you’ll be able to detect the existence of new rogue devices.</li>
    <li style="font-family:arial;">Plug all security holes - If any security issues are detected by your vulnerability scanner, you must plug the security holes immediately. Install any missing security patch, reset the passwords, and update the software.

</li>
</ol>
<h1 style="font-family:arial; color: #f64c72"">Conclusion</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-size: 12;">Wireless networks provide several advantages through allowing users to access network resources and the internet from various locations without being tethered to a physical connection. Despite the convenience that it provides, it is important to keep in mind that wireless networks also pose security challenges including unauthorized access and interference from other wireless devices. To ensure that no security breachers or data leakage will occur, the security of wireless networks must be evaluated to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</p>
